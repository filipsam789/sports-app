# sports-app

**Topic: A sports application using Angular, Firebase and JavaScript**
> Made with the help of: Filip Samardjiski - https://github.com/filipsam789

**Subject**: Basics of web design

*I made this application without prior knowledge of Angular, Firebase and JavaScript, with the help of online tutorials and documentation and help and support from a colleague. 
The application is something like a website of a gym, which implements support for online training. Using the Firestore database, I can view messages sent to the site using the
contact form. Due to a bug in calculating BMI, please refresh the page before filling out the form.*
